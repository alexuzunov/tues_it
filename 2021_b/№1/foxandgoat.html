			<h1>The Fox and the Goat</h1>
			<br>
			<p>Once <i>a fox</i> was roaming around in the dark. Unfortunately, he fell into a well. 
			<br>He tried his level best to come out but all in vain. So, he had no other alternative but to remain there until the next morning. 
			<br>The next day, <i>a goat</i> came that way. She peeped into the well and saw <i>the fox</i> there. <i>The goat</i> asked, “What are you doing there, Mr. Fox?”
			<br><i>The sly fox</i> replied, “I came here to drink water. It is the best I have ever tasted. Come and see for yourself.” 
			<br>Without thinking even for a while, <i>the goat</i> jumped into the well, quenched her thirst and looked for a way to get out. 
			<br>But just like <i>the fox</i>, she also found herself helpless to come out.
			<br>Then <i>the fox</i> said, “I have an idea. You stand on your hind legs. I’ll climb on your head and get out. Then I shall help you come out too.” 
			<br><i>The goat</i> was innocent enough to understand the shrewdness of <i>the fox</i> and did as <i>the fox</i> said and helped him get out of the well.
			<br>While walking away, <i>the fox</i> said, “Had you been intelligent enough, you would never have got in without seeing how to get out.”
